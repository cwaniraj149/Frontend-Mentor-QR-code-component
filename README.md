## Overview
This project is a good start to using and enhancing one's HTML and CSS skills. The overall experience of doing this project is quite good.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

Using HTML and CSS I designed this project. This project was quite simple and easy. As the actual dimensions of image and other few minor details were not provided so I assumed it by myself.  

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Resposnive


### What I learned

Basically, through this project, I learned about Flexbox.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:flex;
  flex-direction: row; /*flex-direction is row by default. Another value is column.*/
   justify-content: center;  /* Values: flex-start, flex-end, space-around and space-between. */
  align-items: center; /* Values: flex-start, flex-end, stretch and baseline */
}
```

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rs2ND1ryYc&t=12479s) - This CSS explanation is very good and helped me to understand the concept of Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This amazing site helped me revise concepts while doing this project.
